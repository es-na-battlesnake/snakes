# Enhanced Ruby Snake Strategy Analysis

## Current Performance Issues

### Critical Problems Identified:
1. **Wall Detection Bug**: Snake disappearing from board in short games (6 turns)
2. **Poor win rate**: 0/20 against pathy (should be ~16% based on previous testing)
3. **Basic survival issues**: Not surviving initial game phases

### Analysis of Current vs Pathy Snake:

**Pathy Snake Advantages:**
1. **Sophisticated pathfinding**: Cost-based grid system with dynamic costs
2. **Smart food selection**: Only goes for food if health < 85, avoids surrounded food
3. **Enemy size awareness**: Different costs for larger vs smaller snake proximity
4. **Tail prediction**: Makes enemy tails walkable if they didn't eat last turn
5. **Performance**: Written in Go, inherently faster

**Our Current Issues:**
1. **Basic safety failure**: Wall detection not preventing crashes
2. **Too aggressive food seeking**: Health threshold of 75 vs pathy's 85
3. **Poor enemy prediction**: Simple compared to pathy's sophisticated logic
4. **Complex scoring system**: May be causing performance issues or bugs

## Strategic Improvements Needed

### Immediate Fixes (Critical):
1. Fix wall detection and basic collision avoidance
2. Simplify move logic to ensure survival
3. Improve health threshold to be more conservative
4. Add better enemy head collision avoidance

### Advanced Improvements:
1. Implement cost-based pathfinding like pathy
2. Add tail prediction for more accurate space calculations
3. Improve food selection criteria
4. Better endgame strategies
