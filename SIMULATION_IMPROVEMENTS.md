# Simulation Infrastructure Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Removed Vendor/Cache Files
- **Problem**: 55MB of Ruby gems and build artifacts were committed to the repository
- **Solution**: Removed `vendor/` and `.bundle/` directories from git tracking
- **Prevention**: Updated `.gitignore` to exclude these directories permanently

### 2. Improved Simulation Output Parsing
- **Problem**: Turn counts showing as "(null turns)" due to parsing failures
- **Solution**: Enhanced parsing logic to handle multiple battlesnake CLI output formats
- **Features**:
  - Robust JSON parsing with fallback to text-based parsing
  - Support for different CLI output formats (JSON and plain text)
  - Enhanced error handling and debugging capabilities
  - Extraction of elimination reasons (collision, out of bounds, etc.)

### 3. Enhanced Battlesnake CLI Installation
- **Problem**: CLI installation failing in different environments
- **Solution**: Multi-method installation approach
- **Features**:
  - Try multiple installation paths
  - Fallback to downloading precompiled binaries
  - Better error messages and diagnostics

## Improved Output Format

The simulation now provides more detailed information:

**Before:**
```
Run [1/30] WIN (null turns)
Run [2/30] LOSS (null turns)
```

**After:**
```
Run [1/30] WIN (42 turns) opponent eliminated
Run [2/30] LOSS (15 turns) collision
Run [3/30] DRAW (89 turns) mutual elimination
```

## Debug Mode

Set `DEBUG=1` environment variable to preserve game logs for investigation:
```bash
DEBUG=1 ./script/comprehensive_simulation
```

## Technical Details

### Parsing Logic
1. **JSON Format**: Attempts to parse standard battlesnake CLI JSON output
2. **Text Format**: Falls back to regex parsing for plain text output
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles malformed or missing output
4. **Turn Counting**: Extracts turn count from multiple possible fields

### Elimination Reasons
The simulation now attempts to extract and display why games ended:
- `collision` - Snake hit another snake or itself
- `out of bounds` - Snake hit the wall
- `starvation` - Snake ran out of health
- `timeout` - Snake took too long to respond
- `opponent eliminated` - Other snake was eliminated first
- `mutual elimination` - Both snakes eliminated simultaneously

This provides much more actionable feedback for improving snake performance.
