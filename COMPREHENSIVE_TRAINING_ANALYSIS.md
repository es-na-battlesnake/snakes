### 🏆 Performance Grading System (Fully Implemented)

**Elite Performance Tiers:**
- 🏆 **ELITE (80%+)**: Tournament-ready performance, exceptional competitive rating
- 🌟 **EXCELLENT (65%+)**: Highly competitive, strong strategic consistency  
- 👍 **GOOD (50%+)**: Solid competitive snake, reliable performance
- ⚠️ **FAIR (35%+)**: Needs strategic improvements, inconsistent results
- 🔧 **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (<35%)**: Fundamental algorithmic issues requiring attention

## 🧠 Deep Training Capabilities & State Logging

### Advanced Analytics Engine
```bash
# Comprehensive game state capture includes:
• Turn-by-turn decision analysis with reasoning
• Elimination reason classification (collision, starvation, timeout, out-of-bounds)
• Response time monitoring (targeting <5ms tournament performance)
• Strategic pattern recognition across opponent types
• Win/loss trend analysis with confidence intervals
```

### Multi-Configuration Training Scenarios
1. **Standard Royale** (11x11, 2-4 snakes): Core competitive format
2. **Wrapped Mode** (11x11, wrapping edges): Advanced spatial reasoning
3. **Hazard Islands** (11x11, dynamic hazards): Environmental adaptation
4. **Large Maps** (19x19, extended gameplay): Endgame strategy testing  
5. **Small Maps** (7x7, intense competition): Aggressive tactical training

### Strategic Insights Engine
```bash
# AI-Generated Recommendations Per Opponent:
• High collision rate → Focus on collision avoidance algorithms
• Starvation losses → Improve food acquisition strategies  
• Short games → Enhance early game survival tactics
• Poor vs easy opponents → Basic algorithm improvements needed
• Strong vs hard opponents → Advanced strategic capabilities confirmed
```
