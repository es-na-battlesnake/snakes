# ES NA Battlesnakes

[Battlesnakes](https://play.battlesnake.com/) created by a [small team](https://play.battlesnake.com/t/es-na/) of GitHub Enterprise Support Engineers as a learning and team-building exercise.

## Adding snakes

1. Add snake directory within `snakes`
2. Make new program config in `supervisord.conf` choosing a new port. Currently we have snakes in two languages (Ruby and Go)
     - Ruby snakes run on ports 4567+
     - Go snakes run on 8080+



## Running snakes

### Codespaces

1. Run `script/server` to launch all snakes
2. [Make port public](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace#sharing-a-port) as needed to access from outside

### Docker

1. `docker build -t battlesnake .`
2. `docker run -p 4567:4567 -d battlesnake`

## Testing snakes

Beyond language and snake-specific testing, we also run simulated games to get quick feedback on how snakes are performing.

## Deployment ðŸš€

To deploy a change to this repository, follow the general process laid out below:

1. Create a new branch and pull request with your changes
1. Observe CI to ensure it is passing
1. Get an approval from from the required codeowners
1. Run `.deploy` on your pull request to deploy your changes to production
1. If you branch deployment completes successfully, merge your pull request!

To roll back a deployment to the last `main` version, run `.deploy main`.
